# Low Resource Bag Valve Mask (BVM) Ventilator

![Current Mechanical Concept](images/current_concept.png)

The OpenLung Emergency Medical Ventilator (OEMV) is a stopgap solution to the global shortage of medical ventilators. Its rapid development is the result of a novel open source paradigm that allows team members to make real-time contributions from any place in the world. DevOps is overseen by a cabal of professionals whom separate the wheat from the chaff and direct the collective effort. The device itself is composed of widely available materials and put together via simple fabrication processes. Electrical components and software have also been developed, these allow basic parameters and controls to be set by clinicians. Physical working prototypes have been built and testing toward a final product is well underway. The OEMV is an open piece of technology that can be manufactured and deployed anywhere in the world.

# Design Requirements

Project Requirements are listed [here](requirements/design-requirements.md).

# Contributing to the project

*OpenLung* as implied by the name has maintained a high degree of openness to new contributors. In fact, we have created a wiki called [Contributing](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/ventilator/OpenLung/-/wikis/Contributing) for this purpose

# Design

The *OpenLung* project has managed to bring together many experts and ideas into a cohesive remote work environment. We believe our processes are unique and efficient for the future of remote group design work. In fact, we have attempted to compile what we have learned in the [Design Wiki](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/ventilator/OpenLung/-/wikis/Design) Additionally there are discipline specific Wikis for [Electronics](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/ventilator/OpenLung/-/wikis/Electronics) and [Mechanical](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/ventilator/OpenLung/-/wikis/Mechanical). Our designs require parameters, suggestions and direction of the medical community, some of those notes are compiled in [Medical Notes](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/ventilator/OpenLung/-/wikis/Medical-Notes)

# Documentation

A major factor in the success of this open source project is having extensive, clear and accessible documentation. Though we here at OpenLung see room for improvements, we would like to share our documentation process including what we have learned, examples we like and methods we use. [Documentation Wiki](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/ventilator/OpenLung/-/wikis/Documentation)

# Fabrication

Despite *OpenLung* not being a manufacturer, this project designs for manufacturability. In fact, we have labored over the consideration of variability in production processes and supply chains. Detailed information regarding fabrication -- as it relates to this project -- is stored on [the 'Fabrication' page](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/ventilator/OpenLung/-/wikis/Fabrication)

# Testing

Evaluating the performance of our designs require extensive testing and data collection.
Testing is done using specialized equipment that is discussed in further detail within the [Testing Wiki](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/ventilator/OpenLung/-/wikis/Testing)

# Distribution

The logistics of providing designs for decentralized ad-hoc manufacturing operations is interesting and complex. That is why we created a whole [Wiki Page](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/ventilator/OpenLung/-/wikis/Distribution) dedicated to this
